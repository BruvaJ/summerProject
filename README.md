This was an exploration of gamification in language learning. 
The goal was to create a fully interactive game that was driven by language study. Essentially the format follows flashcards,
but with game elements attached:

- Each successful response spawns a unit that moves from the left side of the screen to the right
- Chaining up successful responses will spawn a stronger unit.
- incorrect responses prevent answering any new questions for several seconds
